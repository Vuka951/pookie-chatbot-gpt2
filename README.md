# 🌟 Pookie Chatbot Project (GPT2) 🌟

## 💬 Project Overview

Welcome to the **Pookie Chatbot Project**, where magic happens! ✨

---

## 🥅 Goals of the Project

- Create a chatbot that feels like it’s stealing your heart with every response. 💖
- Serve as an example of how to take a model from hugging face and train it from scratch on a datase AKA. show the whole flow (create, train, run) 🧠
- **⚠️ All of this (running, training) should be achievable on a not so powerful laptop (eg. M1) with decent performance. This is a key requirement and must not be compromised!** 🗑️💻
  - For this reason, the GPT-2 model is used, which has a manageable size and resource requirement compared to larger models like GPT-3 or GPT-4.

## 🚀 Project Workflow

Follow this smooth, seductive workflow to get it working:

1. **Setup**

   - Run `setup_pookie_chatbot.py` to create the custom tokenizer and initialize (lobotomize) a fresh GPT-2 model. 🛠️
   - Only do this once unless you’re feeling adventurous and want to tweak the tokenizer or dataset. 😉

2. **Training**

   - Run `train_pookie.py` to fine-tune the model. 🏋️‍♂️
   - Repeat training **10 or more times** (or increase the ephos) to achieve that sweet spot of a loss around **1.5**. The more you train, the better it should get. 😘

3. **Testing the Chatbot**
   - Once fine-tuned, run `run_pookie_chatbot.py` to test your chatbot in an interactive session. 🎭
   - Watch as it dazzles you with coherent (not really), context-aware(not really) responses. 🌟

## 🔮 Additional Notes

- If you have any suggestions for improvements or find any issues, please open a pull request. 💡
- On the other hand, if you had a fun time using this code, please ⭐ the repo and spread some love. 🫶
- Most code should be commented well and explained since how stuff works will be mostly forgotten after a few motnhs of not touching this 🚫🧠
- The overfitting is intentional because of the small dataset. 📜
